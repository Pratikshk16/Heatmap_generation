# Heatmap_generation
This project focuses on generating heatmaps from surveillance or crowd videos to visualize regions of frequent human activity. By applying background subtraction techniques and accumulating motion data across frames, we create a color-coded representation of “hot zones” (frequent movement areas) and “cold zones” (rarely used spaces).
